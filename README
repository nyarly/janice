Janice is an experimental testing framework that results from a series of
observations:

Real programs, sadly, depend on side effects and persistence.  Relational
Transparency would be lovely, but there's this real world knocking at the door
and demanding rent.

Mocks can embed horrible brittlenes in a test suite.  They tend to encode
assumptions about the systems they represent.

Fixtures require that we know all kinds of things about the systems they
represent.  In some ways, they can be as brittle as Mocks.

Integration tests are slow, but a necessary evil, since ultimately they're the
only way to test the assumptions we encode in mocks or fixtures.

But what if every Mock/Fixture were the consequence of a test?  Then the
assumptions you're making will be checked for real.  And the requirements of
your tests for their mocks will enforce and guide a testing dicipline on the
units.
